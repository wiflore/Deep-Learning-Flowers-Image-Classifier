# ImageClassifierDSND

1. Installations   
importlib, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, collections, PIL, torch, torchvision, libraries are required

2. Project Motivation   

    Implement an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images and use the trained model to classify    new images. This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist term 1 Nanodegree. 

    I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using PyTorch and NN with GPU. 

    The project is broken down into multiple steps:

      - Load and preprocess the image dataset
      - Train the image classifier on your dataset
      - Use the trained classifier to predict image content

3. File Descriptions  
Image Classifier Project.html and Image Classifier Project.ipynb contain all the code in a html and Jupyter format respectively. 
predict.py, train.py, utils.py works to use the classifier with commands.
